In normal functions, we can use the chain rule to compute the differential of a function. However, in stochastic calculus, we need to use Ito\'s lemma.\\n\\nSuppose we have a stochastic process $X_t$ that follows a stochastic differential equation (SDE).\\n\\n$$\\ndX_t = \\\\mu(X_t, t) dt + \\\\sigma(X_t, t) dW_t\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $W_t$ is a Wiener process (or Brownian motion), $\\\\mu(X_t, t)$ is the drift term, and $\\\\sigma(X_t, t)$ is the diffusion term.\\n\\nNow, let\'s say we have a function $f(X_t, t)$ (twice differentiable) that we want to differentiate with respect to time. Ito\'s lemma states that the differential of $f(X_t, t)$ is given by:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{\\\\Delta f(t)}{dt} dt\\n= \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial t} dt\\n+ \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2f}{\\\\partial t^2} (dt)^2\\n+ \\\\cdots\\n$$\\n\\nand so with $x$, the total derivative of $f$ will be\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned }\\ndf &= f_t dt + f_x dx \\\\\\\\\\n&=\\\\lim_{dx, dt\\\\rightarrow 0, 0} \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial t} dt\\n+ \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x} dx\\n+ \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2f}{\\\\partial t^2} (dt)^2\\n+ \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2f}{\\\\partial x^2} (dx)^2 \\\\right)\\n+ \\\\cdots\\n\\\\end{aligned }\\n$$\\n\\nThan substitute $x = X_t$, in the limit $dt \\\\to 0$, the following terms tend to zero faster than $dt$ are:\\n\\n1. $(dt)^2$\\n\\n2. $dtdW_t$\\n\\n3. $(dx)^3$\\n\\nNoted that $(dB_t)^2 = \\\\mathcal{O}(dt)$ due to quadratic variation of a Wiener process. # TODO,\\nHance\\n\\n$$\\ndf\\n= \\\\lim_{dt \\\\to 0} \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial t}\\n+ \\\\mu_t \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x}\\n+ \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_t^2}{2} \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 f}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\right) dt\\n+ \\\\sigma_t \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x} dW_t\\n$$\\n\\nThat\'s it!"}]}}')}}]);
