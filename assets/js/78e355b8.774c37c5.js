Here is the points that I summarized from the Machine Learning Operations with Vertex AI tutorial from Google.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nIn general, the evaluation methods can be categorized into several types:\\n\\n1. Binary Evaluation\\n    - e.g. positive or negative sentiment analysis, spam detection, and appropriate content detection.\\n\\n2. Category Evaluation\\n    - e.g. topic classification, sentiment analysis including neutral, and product rating.\\n\\n3. Ranking Evaluation\\n    - Rank the relative quality for different outputs.\\n    - e.g. ranking search results, ranking product recommendations, and ranking news articles.\\n\\n4. Numerical Evaluation\\n    - Assigns a quantitative score to model output.\\n    - e.g. BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, perplexity, and F1 score.\\n\\n5. Text Evaluation\\n    - Evaluation of the text by human.\\n\\n6. Multi-task Evaluation\\n    - Mixture of the above methods.\\n\\nThe choice of evaluation method depends on the specific task and the goals of the evaluation. Below are some examples:\\n\\n1. Lexical Similarity\\n    - Measure the similarity between the model\'s output and reference text, based on word overlap, sequence of words, or semantic similarity.\\n    - e.g. BLEU focuses on n-gram overlap, ROUGE focuses on recall, and METEOR focuses on both precision and recall.\\n\\n2. Linguistic Quality\\n    - Evaluate the fluency, coherence, and grammatical correctness of the generated text.\\n    - e.g. Perplexity, BLEURT.\\n\\n3. Task-Specific Evaluation\\n    - Evaluate the performance of the model on specific tasks, such as summarization, translation, or question answering.\\n    - e.g. BLEU for translation, and ROUGE for summarization.\\n\\n4. Safety and fairness\\n    - Evaluate the model\'s output for safety and fairness, including bias detection and harmful content detection.\\n    - e.g. toxicity detection, hate speech detection, and bias detection or even human evaluation.\\n\\n5. Groundedness\\n    - Evaluate the factual accuracy of the model\'s output.\\n    - e.g. Fact-checking tools, knowledge-based integration and human evaluation.\\n\\n6. User-Centric Evaluation\\n    - Focus on the user experience and satisfaction with the model\'s output.\\n    - e.g. User survey.\\n\\nMoreover, there are some common evaluation paradigms:\\n\\n1. Pointwise Evaluation:\\n    - Evaluating model behavior in production.\\n    - Absolute performance of a single model.\\n    - Identifying behaviors to prioritize for tuning.\\n    - Establishing a baseline for model performance.\\n\\n2. Pairwise Evaluation:\\n    - Comparison of two models.\\n\\nEvaluation methods are not only computation based, but also be model based, using LLM as a judge to evaluate the model output (Google Auto Side by Side). In summary, the choice of evaluation method depends on the specific task and the goals of the evaluation. I may talk about more about the evaluation metrics in the future."},{"id":"ito-lamma","metadata":{"permalink":"/knowledge-base/blog/ito-lamma","editUrl":"https://github.com/HinnyTsang/knowledge-base/tree/main/blog/blog/2025-05-13-ito-lamma.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-05-13-ito-lamma.md","title":"Ito\'s Lamma","description":"In very simple terms, Ito\'s lemma is a formula that allows us to compute the differential of a function of a stochastic process.
